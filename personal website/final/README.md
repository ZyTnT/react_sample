# Yutong Studio Website
    This is a SPA project using create-react-app about a fake company(Yutong Studio). The business of this studio is to help clients design and create apps according to their requirements. So I put some project that I have done before on website.
    This project includes 5 main views and 4 sub-views. Switching between views is done using react-router-dom
## Complex UI Elements
    I mix icon, link and image into a circle logo, which can be seen and clicked on home page. And I make a tabs view to show my previous project on work page.
    In addition, these are some nested elements on top of main content and about page.

## Loading Indicator
    You can see loading indicator on contact page after you submit your information by submit button interaction. To prevent it from disappearing too quickly, I set a one-second pause.

## Animation
    I use some css animation on profile image on About page.

## Privacy Statment
    You can enter privacy page by link on the bottom of website.
